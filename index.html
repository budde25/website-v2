    <p>
        Hello, I'm currently a student at <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin - Madison</a>. I
        intend
        to graduate in May of 2022 with a B.S in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm currently interning as a back-end developer at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en?ar=1">IBM</a> in their
        operating systems group and will start full time in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy back-end development with an interest in systems level programming. My
        favorite programming language is <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. I am an open source enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please take a look at some of my <a href="projects">projects</a>.
