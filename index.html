        I'm currently working as a back-end developer at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en?ar=1">IBM</a> Rochester on
        the IBM i OS.
    </p>
    <p>
        I graduated from <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin - Madison</a> in May of 2022 with a
        a B.S in Computer Science and Leadership Certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy back-end development with an interest in systems level programming. My
        favorite programming language is <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. I am an open source enthusiast.
