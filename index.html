<article>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm currently a student at University of Wisconsin - Madison. I intend
        graduate in May of 2022 with a B.S in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm working at the UW Computer Systems Lab as a Systems Administrator.
        This summer I will be working as a back-end developer at IBM in their operating systems group.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy back-end development with an interest in systems level programming. My
        favorite programming language is Rust and am a big fan of open source software.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please take a look at some of my <a href="projects">projects</a>.
